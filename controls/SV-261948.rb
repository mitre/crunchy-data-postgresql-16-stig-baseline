PostgreSQL can be configured to audit these requests using pgaudit. Refer to supplementary content APPENDIX-B for documentation on installing pgaudit.

With pgaudit installed the following configurations can be made:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf

Add the following parameters (or edit existing parameters):

As the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:

$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}"
