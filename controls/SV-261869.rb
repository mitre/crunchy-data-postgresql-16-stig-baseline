  desc 'Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic analysis. Without
	establishing the source of the event, it is impossible to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
	relating to an incident.

To compile an accurate risk assessment and provide forensic analysis, it is essential for security personnel to
know where events occurred, such as application components, modules, session identifiers, filenames, host names,
and functionality.

In addition to logging where events occur within the application, the application must also produce audit records
that identify the application itself as the source of the event.

Associating information about the source of the event within the application provides a means of investigating an
attack; recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured application.'
  desc 'check', 'Check PostgreSQL settings and existing audit records to verify information specific to the source (origin) of the event is being captured and stored with audit records.

As the database administrator (usually postgres) check the current log_line_prefix and log_hostname setting by running the following SQL:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ psql -c "SHOW log_line_prefix"
$ psql -c "SHOW log_hostname"

For a complete list of extra information that can be added to log_line_prefix, refer to the official documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-LINE-PREFIX.

If the current settings do not provide enough information regarding the source of the event, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', "Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA and PGVER environment variables. Refer to APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA and APPENDIX-H for PGVER.

To ensure logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.

If logging is enabled, the following configurations can be made to log the source of an event.

As the database administrator, edit postgresql.conf:

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf

###### Log Line Prefix

Extra parameters can be added to the setting log_line_prefix to log source of event:

# %a = application name
# %u = user name
# %d = database name
# %r = remote host and port
# %p = process ID
# %m = timestamp with milliseconds

For example:
log_line_prefix = '< %m %a %u %d %r %p %m >'

###### Log Hostname

By default, only IP address is logged. To also log the hostname, the following parameter can also be set in postgresql.conf:

log_hostname = on

As the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:

$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}"
